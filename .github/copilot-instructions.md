# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Never write comments unless explicitly asked**
- Do not add docstrings, inline comments, or documentation comments
- Code should be self-explanatory through clear naming and structure
- Focus on writing clean, readable code without commentary
- Do not create **init**.py files, as they are not needed in Python 3.3 and above

## Python Environment Guidelines

- When running Python code or tests, always use the project's virtual environment (the venv folder in the project root)
